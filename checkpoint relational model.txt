Explanation of Relationships:
The Reservation table links the Guest, Hotel, and Room tables through their respective foreign keys.
The Hotel table has a one-to-many relationship with the Room table (a hotel can have many rooms).
The Guest table has a one-to-many relationship with the Reservation table (a guest can make many reservations).
The Room table has a one-to-many relationship with the Reservation table (a room can be reserved multiple times).
This relational model will allow the director to manage and track hotel data, guest reservations, and room availability efficiently.
